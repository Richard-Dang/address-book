# Address Book

## Description
A database program in the form of an address book which allows users to create, open, and save
address books. Users may create one address book at a time and may add or modify records in it which
consist of four entry fields: first name, last name, email and phone number. They can also move back and 
forth between records in the current address book and view saved entries. Emails and phone numbers entered
must fulfill a certain criteria in order to be saved or else the program will save the entries as blank. 
In addition, only a max of 50 records may be created at any time per address book. Correctly entered
names and phone numbers will automatically be formatted by the program accordingly and users are only
required to enter one of four fields in order to add a new record. Only .xyz files created by this program
may be opened and users cannot save blank address books.
